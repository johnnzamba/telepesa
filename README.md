### GENERAL WORKFLOW
This is a one of a kind integration of a telegram bot and TinyPesa Mobile Payment API service. Once the user chooses to make a payment; an STK push is made and the user prompted to make a payment. After successful payment(s) the transaction details are logged into the JSON file. 
However, what the script does is that once an STK push has been made, an external reference_no is generated to it. This ref_no is then used to get a transaction(s) status once the STK timeout.
The 1À¢·µó response is logged into the JSON file, then the 2‚Åø·µà response is logged if the MPESA transaction is complete.

```
```bash
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
